Wind lidar allow the remote measurement of wind speed from the ground, from wind turbines and other platforms, from aircraft, and from space. They have applications for wind energy, meteorology, environment, transport, and many other sectors. 

Because it has so many applications and replaces other devices that have been in use for decades, wind lidar is quite a disruptive technology. I've experienced this process from several different perspectives over the last decade. I've been a lidar vendor trying to sell lidar; I've been a consultant, helping clients adopt it; I've been a researcher, trying to advance the state of the art [^Newman_Clifton_2017]; and since 2018, I've been the Operating Agent of an IEA Wind Task working to enable international collaboration [^Clifton_Clive_2018].

## The process of technology adoption

The story of wind lidar commercialisation may sound familiar. A promising technology was pulled out of the labs by startups, and then trialled with key influencers. It was then gradually picked up by customers who were willing to take a risk. Those early adopters got access to technology that could provide commercial advantages, but had to do a lot of learning. But, those early adopters helped shape the development of the product, which is why today one of the more common applications is using vertically-profiling lidar to replace met masts (it was an obvious use case). Gradually a critical mass of users was reached who then developed recommended practices and more recently, standards. Later adopters have benefitted from stable technology that is well-established, but still have to learn how to integrate it in to their businesses. 

We've recently heard that some wind plant developers now have completely lidar-based processes. At the same time, others have yet to use lidar for anything other than trials. Those later adopters are probably five years behind in their adoption process, as the challenge is not just to deploy lidar but also to work with consultants, investors, and independent engineers to demonstrate that wind lidar can be effectively and confidently integrated in to their businesses.

## How international collaboration can help with technology transfer

IEA Wind Task 32 works to identify and mitigate the barriers to the adoption of wind lidar. We do this by providing a forum for all of the people and organisations involved in the technology transfer pipeline to meet, discuss, and take actions. Our process has been relatively similar across use cases:

1. Lots of information exchange about community-level experience, needs, and opportunities
1. Identify a clear use case to focus efforts
1. Workshops and events to target that use case
1. Gather evidence to show how well lidar can work for that use case
1. Establish a strategy to support deployment for that use case[^Task32_strategy]
1. Create tools, recommended practices, and disseminate those across the community
1. Communicate, communicate, communicate.

The end result of this has been to provide a favourable climate for the acceptance of wind lidar. Couple this with the drop in lidar prices and the development of an ecosystem of third-party service providers, and you've got many of the things that you need for commercialisation and widespread adoption.

## Where next?

There's currently a push to develop better (or new) standards for a wide range of use cases. This will help users apply lidar for their application, which will increase sales. Then, the lidars themselves will get cheaper as economies of scale come in to play. That will lead to wider adoption, and further drops in prices. 

Longer term I think that wind lidar for wind energy applications will slowly become commoditised as prices drop. Once that happens, the key will be the value-add by integrating lidar into digital businesses. Value add will also come by enabling bigger, more reliable turbines in more responsive wind parks. That will mean that wind lidar devices and users will have to become even more digital than they are already. We'll alos have to think of how to make them interoperable; effectively we have to hide more and more of the technology from the users behind a layer of experience embedded in software. That's where [digitalisation](../../../../tags/#digitalisation) and [open science](../../../../tags/#open-science) come into play.
