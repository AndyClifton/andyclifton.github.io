How much scientific advancement really sees the light of day? How may scientists waste time working on things that were done 5, 10, or 20 years ago? And how much work gets duplicated in R&D labs around the world?

Wouldn't it be better if we could avoid all of this waste? Wouldn't it be better if we could let scientists leverage each others' work and expertise? Wouldn't it be better if scientists could work together more easily?

These are just some of the reasons that I am interested in the idea of _open science_, which is the movement to make the process and products of science open to all.

My own journey here has been interesting. When I graduated in 2001, there was relatively little awareness of "openness". It was enough to write and publish a paper - that was supposed to capture everything and allow others to repeat your work. You could dump some code on an intranet somewhere and hope others in your own company found it, but in reality everyone was working alone.

Over the years I have been introduced to new ways of working together, new approaches to coding, and my own horizons have expanded as a result of working in academia, industry, and government in the USA, Canada, Germany, and Switzerland.

Now, in 2020, we have a much better set of tools to allow us to be open. We have the internet, licenses, GitHub, and many other things that allow data to be FAIR - findable, accessible, interoperable, and repeatable - and understand the goal of writing code that embodies the R<sup>5</sup> ideas of re-run, repeat, reproduce, reuse, and replicate[^R5].

We also realise that open science principles should be applied to restricted data and restricted research, as they are principles that add value to any R&D activities.

Open science is highly likely to edge closed and restricted science out. Take the simple example of a problem or project that is too big for one person alone to handle. You'll look for collaborators; given the choice between one that applies open science (and is thus easy to collaborate with) and one that uses restrictive practices, its clear who you'd rather work with. The same principle will apply to products and services, too.

How am I helping? Here are a few ways:
1. [Teaching open science to new PhD candidates](../../../../posts/2020/11/open-science/)
1. Applying open science to wind lidar, for example developing the [Open Lidar modular lidar concept](https://zenodo.org/record/3414197) and setting up a [publications library for IEA Wind Task 32](https://zenodo.org/communities/ieawindtask32/)
1. [Helping my colleagues to share their code](https://github.com/SWE-UniStuttgart/ViConDAR)
1. [Working with startups to commercialise tools for sharing data and code]()
1. Engaging with initiatives to create an [open data standard for the energy system](https://icebreakerone.org/2020/06/01/open-energy/)

These are all relatively simple ways I've found to make a difference. Maybe you can find something similar in your field?
