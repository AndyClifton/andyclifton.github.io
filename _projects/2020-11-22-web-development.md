Over the last couple of years I've tried to learn a bit about software development. What easier way to do that, than learning by doing?

## Things I've learned the hard way
Many of these will be familiar...
### My django playground
I am sure that every web developer has a sort-of-MVP django site somewhere on netlify or heroku. This is probably something with horrific models, crazy dependencies and a front-end that you really aren't proud of, but _it was sooo close_ to working and it was going to make a million and ... but yeah, it's not quite there.

Me too. I'll not share the URLs, but let's just say that I managed to get an AWS bucket talking to Heroku and have a development-staging-production workflow running. Every couple of weeks I sit down and attack my MVP project issues list on GitHub, and I might just launch it next year. Honest.

### Jekyll
This site is based on Jekyll. I've also put together another couple for my startups over the years. I love the simplicity and ability to separate content from layout. The fact that there's no database to corrupt is even better.

I also like the fact that I can store the content on my GitHub account and [serve it from there](https://www.twilio.com/blog/redirect-github-to-custom-domain).

### Wordpress
OK, I confess, when I first started playing with web development I thought I would focus on content and just use wordpress and elementor to deliver something that looked pretty enough. But, I pretty soon got frustrated with the whole thing, and although I built [www.windfors.de](http://www.windfors.de) on it, I doubt I will continue to use it. No chance to use CI, a database that seems to break if you look at it funny, and awful templating.

### Bootstrap for the win
I am not good at the creative side of web design. I am not one for doing your graphic design. So most of my front-end work has been functional, heavily leveraging bootstrap.

### React
I like the concept of separating logic from interface, but I've never managed to get my head around React. 'nuff said.

## But... why?
I know that I will never be a real web developer, or even particularly capable. However, the future of science and engineering is digital. In future our machines will be networked and cooperating. Playing around with web development has just been a way for me to learn new skills like agile project management, continuous integration, and to understand some of how the internet's plumbing works. This experience will help me if I need to manage software projects, and has definitely changed my approach to project management.
