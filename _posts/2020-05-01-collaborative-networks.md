excerpt: "Research networks are essential for succesful RD&D. In this first of a series about research networks I'll share some of my experience and ideas about how to set up and run them, what makes them effective, and how benefit from them.<br/><img src='/images/alina-grubnyak-ZiQkhI7417A-unsplash_500W.jpg' style='border: 1px solid;'>"

I'm a firm believer in the power of collaboration to solve problems. Collaboration can help because either the problem is so big that you can't solve it on your own, or because there are limited resources available. The deployment of weather-driven renewable energy is such a big challenge that it simply cannot be done alone. Even "small" parts of it, like understanding the link between the weather and the facility are huge problems on their own.

In **IEA Wind Task 32** on wind lidar, we work on identifying and mitigating the barriers to the adoption of wind lidar for wind energy applications. We have around 1,000 followers who are somewhat aware of what we do, around 100 participants who participate very actively in events, a core of 10-20 who help us organise and do things, and a team of 3 (led by me) who manage the whole thing. 

I'm particularly pleased with the breadth and depth of the community that we've built, and also by our ability to pivot and address new challenges over the years. We've worked really hard on communications to keep our stakeholders up to date with our plans[^Clifton_2020_a] and disseminate our results[^Clifton_2019_a]. We've had good feedback for many years, even with the switch to remote events because of COVID.

It's not all plain sailing, though; I worry about how we get the next generation involved, and so we've recently started a collaboration with an EU-funded training network to get new PhD students integrated into the wider community.

**The Power Curve Working Group** was an industry group aimed at understanding the real-world performance of wind turbines. The group carried out a series of data-sharing exercises that then morphed into _experience_ sharing exercises, which were a great way to understand the state of the wind energy industry in this area[^Lee_2020_a]. The PCWG is also a good example of what to do with a succesful network that has reached the end of its mandate. In 2020, the group was folded in to the Consortium for the Advancement of Remote Sensing (CFARS).

What worked well here? Regular meetings to keep momentum. What didn't work so well? We produced a lot of material but didn't always capture it. So, in 2019 we started a [Zenodo repository]() to bring it together.
