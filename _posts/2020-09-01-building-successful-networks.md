Networks of people and organisations can be amazingly effective ways of addressing a community's needs. But there are many challenges that the network needs to overcome. What do you need to do to be successful?

## Why we build networks
Networks bring together people and organisations, creating a community to address common needs. A network is not just your usual club or society; networks help people meet and work together with a common goal. This could be for anything from fundraising to urban renewal, or from wind turbines to face masks. Virtual or in-person. Local or global. The possibilities are endless.

I've been involved with setting up and running common-interest professional networks for over a decade. I've made my fair share of mistakes, and in this article I set out some of the lessons I've learned as a participant and a leader.

## It's not about you
This should be obvious, but... be sure that your decision to set up a network is driven by the needs of the members or those that it is intended to help, not by your own ego.

## Are you legitimate?
You need to have a mandate to act from the community you are trying to represent or support. If you are not legitimate you will have a hard time achieving your goals. At best you will be ignored, often you will just add to the noise, and at worst you will make things worse.

## Do you even need a network? 
It's easy to mistake setting up a network for doing something effective. It's quite possible you are solutionising instead of really helping. If you can't say that your network is clearly helping, don't bother. In some cases, adding a network can reduce focus without bringing anything.


## Identify your partners
Check that your network's goals match your partners', and be prepared to iterate. If there is a big name (a well-known person, organisation, etc.) in this space and your goals align, see if you can co-opt them. Again, ask yourself why not work with them directly rather than set up something new. 


##  Fuzzy around the edges
Networks have interesting dynamics. For the leader and some of the core team, they may be their jobs. In other cases it may be purely voluntary roles, with time snatched at evenings or weekends. In contrast, the network's members are often squeezing it around other commitments. This often leads to  a core group that are fully engaged with the network, and a blurry periphery of members that come and go as they have time and interest. 

It took me a while to realise that this churn isn't a problem. If that's how people want to take part, that's great. New or returning members bring new ideas, new motivation, and new goals. Leverage them!

## Communicate, communicate, communicate
You need to keep in touch with your members, your stakeholders, and your donors / supporting groups. This will take more time than you expect, and will be harder than you think.

Before you start, take some time to set out a communications strategy. Think about who will you communicate what to, and how. Ask how others will reach you. Think about whether you need to create dialog, or broadcast. Always try to match the message to the audience and channel.
- A website helps, but is not essential - you just need an internet presence that can be found by someone with a search engine.
- LinkedIn or Xing will help you reach professionals, but is best suited to short messages with a call to action
- Facebook is a good way to reach the public but not a good way to reach people concerned about privacy.

Your events are also communications. Many networks have held webinars during the COVID-19 lockdown(s) to connect to their members, and those have helped maintain the networks.

Review what works, and don't ignore new trends if they can help you reach different groups.

## Be open
What do you need to hide?

Adopt a default policy of being open and willing to share everything you do. It'll help you adopt good governance practices, and help you integrate your efforts with others'. Your members can see what you are up to, and your stakeholders get more clarity too. Being open is pretty easy once you decide on it:
- Publish minutes of meetings, whether at a management level or of your network. 
- Avoid decisions made between two members of the board over a drink. 
- Communicate, communicate, communicate. 

Openness can have different implications for different networks. For example, if you are doing something technical, you might want to think about adopting [Open Science principles](../projects/projects-1-open-science). But in general, embrace the open mindset and then ask yourselves how you can implement it in your network.


## Embrace marketing

> If a tree falls in the forest and no-one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

Your network does not exist if no-one knows about it. Although some people find it hard, you have to promote your work.

That doesn't mean just yelling to attract attention. It means crafting a message and pushing it out there in the right place at the right time. This is where you leverage your communications tools and your brand, and push information to the people you want to communicate with. Be ready to give them something back when they take an interest.

The difference between communication and marketing is that marketing is usually intended to make your stakeholders do something; it's not just informative. So, a clear "call to action" is essential. Otherwise your marketing activity was wasted.

On that note, think of using something like mailchimp where you get click-through rates. That means you can assess how effective your campaigns are, and adjust the next one.
Your outputs are also part of your marketing. Simple, non-intrusive branding can help. Remember the US-AID logo on bags of flour?

## Your network is a startup
Don't be afraid to admit that things aren't working. Give things some time, sure, but at some point you will need to realise that you aren't as successful as you wanted to be, or the conditions around you have changed. Then, its time to try something a bit different.

If you've got far enough to ask how things are going, they must be _goiing_, so don't throw it all out. Keep your brand, for example, but don't hesitate to rethink what you do, or why. You might have to go through something even more painful, like pruning your network; but given that your members are (normally) your strength, it's usually much better to work out how to realign the network, the leadership, and it's members.

This part of the process is very similar to what startups go through. So, it's often worth looking at educational material developed for them about how to design a product around customers. Having a clear goal - ideally set out as a mission statement and a vision - will help you keep focus. Get it sorted right at the start, and don't be afraid to iterate.

## Regular progress reviews
Set a regular date to review progress and make sure your network's culture enables you to ask difficult questions. If your network's culture doesn't let your members ask if they are doing the right thing, you might want to start with fixing that; a network should not be a tyranny.

## Delegate
If all this sounds a bit much, don't forget to delegate! You are setting up a network of people to do something. By definition, they want to help. Let them! Don't be afraid to ask for help. You will not "lose control"; this network is not about you. If you have a strong vision and communicate well internally, you'll be fine. Trust your colleagues.

## Networks are about people

At the end of the day, professional networks are just webs of personal relationships but with direction and purpose. All of the things that we do as people in our everyday lives to support our personal relationships apply to these networks as well. 

If in doubt, just remember the golden rule - always treat others as you would like to be treated. 

Good luck!
