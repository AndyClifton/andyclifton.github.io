Open science is the movement to make all aspects of scientific research accessible to society. In practice, it means implementing policies and technical measures that allow barrier-free access to results, software, publications arising from research. It's [applicable to academia and private industry](../../posts/2020/02/adopting-open-science/), and it will be essential as our society becomes ever more digital.

Because open science is so important, I joined forces with Nikola Vasiljevic at DTU (an old friend) to look into educating new PhD students about it. We thought that open science was something that they could benefit from being taught rather than just learning by doing. But, one of the problems with open science is that it often feels like a philosophy and not something that can be directly taught to students. And unfortunately, we couldn't find any training material that bridged this gap between philosophy and practice. 

So, in 2020 we set up a open-source "Open Science" course, designed as a series of seminars for up 20 people at a time. I've put most of the material and course structure together with a lot of input from Nikola about material and goals. [We put the course on GitHub](https://github.com/LIKE-ITN/OpenScienceTrainingCourse) and are now testing it out with students from across Europe, South America, and Asia.

The course covers everything you would need to start implementing open science in a typical small R&D group:

1. An introduction to open science
1. Guiding principles; making data FAIR, R<sup>5</sup>
1. Open science and intellectual property; licensing, making money from open science, modularity
1. If a tree falls in the forest... communicating your science; communications strategies to raise awareness of your science
1. What are data management plans and why do they matter?

The course is built around seminar sessions, self-study, and a closing workshop. It's between 60 and 90 hours of study depending on requirements.

The course is reusable and can be adapted for other group sizes. If you'd like to talk about adapting it to your requirements, please get in touch!
