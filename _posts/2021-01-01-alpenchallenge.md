Well, <del>three months and 1,000 km</del><ins>9 months and 3,000 km</ins>, now.

Like the rest of Germany, I bought a new bike during the first COVID lockdown. Here are my experiences.

## My criteria
In no particular order, I was looking for:
- Lightweight. I live on the third floor and have no street-level or basement storage, so I needed to carry it up the stairs.
- Moderately rugged. Although I expected to ride mostly streets, I expected gravel, and probably some single tracks from time to time. 
- Straight bars, because drop bars in traffic are not fun
- Relaxed position but still good for 50–80 km a day sometimes.
- Good value for money. I don't want to pay just for a brand name.
- No suspension, to cut down on maintenance and weight.
- Something that my local bike store would be able and willing to maintain. So probably not a mail-order bike.
- Decent gears. There are quite a few hills around here.
- Potential to use as a commuter if I wanted to.
- Good looking, because I had to want to get on it.

Obviously, this does-everything kind of bike doesn't really exist, but if you are willing to go more in one direction or another, you'll get something. 

A key realisation was that often I would be out with my partner (who is less sporty), and that most of my riding would be on sealed streets or bike routes but with occasional forays into the woods. So a nippy dedicated road bike was out, and I ended up firmly in the trekking / hybrid categories. Some German companies call this "fitness" bikes, a label that makes me cringe. I suppose it's better than "weekend warrior"?

## The options
Finding bikes that fit these criteria was't too hard. There's plenty of German brands in this space, for example Canyon with their roadlite and Pathlite series or the [Bulls Grinder](http:www.bulls.de/kategorie/bikes/rennraeder_und_gravel-bikes/gravel_bikes.html), while the Majors like [Cannondale, Specialised, and Trek have any number of bikes](https://granfondo-cycling.com/the-best-gravel-bike/), and so-on.

I also looked at the Orbea Gain Fxx e-bike series as well, until I got range anxiety and realised I'm really not ready to go electric.

At some point I stumbled on the BMC Alpenchallenge series, but was struggling to find out what they were really about. I was fortunate enough to have a local bike store (LBS) that had a few of the different models of Alpenchallenge in stock.

## The BMC Alpenchallenge series
The [BMC Alpenchallenge series](https://www.bmc-switzerland.com/models/city-active/alpenchallenge.html) is an interesting concept. BMC have started with a typical diamond frame with relatively short rear stays, flat bars, and then a groupset, chain / belt and mudguards (or not) to fit different requirements. There are eight models in total; the 01-xx series are higher-end spec compared to the 02-xx series.

The **2020 Alpenchallenge 01-three** had more of a gravel setup than the other bikes in the series. 2x10 gears, Shimano GRX drivetrain, and in 2020 it was a glorious, gorgeous pearly blue colour, coming in at around 10 kilos. It's also rated as a Class 2 bike, which means its suitable for gravel riding[^rating].

_N.B. it looks like BMC updated their Alpenchallenge models for 2021 and changed the numbering. The 2021 equivalent of the 2020 01-three seems to be the 2020 01-**two**, now._

BMC claim you can fit mudguards and a rack to all of them, so you could potentially add bags, but because of the short stays I would be concerned about heel strike against them. Best to test in advance! If long-distance touring with panniers is your target use, there are definitely other bikes that are better suited at this price point.

## Where are the other reviews?
There are very, very few reviews online about this version of the Alpenchallenge. I found a few reviews of it from back in 2014 and so, but almost nothing about the 2020 01-three. [There is a video on YouTube for the equivalent 2021 version, the 01-two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9dlbyT7iJ8). 

@BMC, if you are reading this, you might want to get your bike out to some of the cycling magazines or websites?

## The first thousand
### First weekend
I tried it out on the Friday evening at a local bike store (LBS) and bought it there and then. It accelerated like crazy and was very responsive. The shorter wheelbase was a bit twitchy but exactly what I was looking for. 

I asked the LBS if he could change the 25-mm slicks for something a bit more appropriate to the gravel tracks and woodland trails in the region. It also strikes me as a bit weird that BMC sell this with a gravel group set and then give you road tyres... anyway, a pair of 32-mm Continental Cross Kings fits really nicely.

Yes, then I stuck the bike in a ditch on the way home by trying to corner on wet cobblestones, but that's firmly user error and nothing to do with the bike!

### The first month
... was mostly about discovering how unfit I am. Did a bit of everything, averaging roughly 100 km a week. The bike was in and out of the trunk of the car (VW Golf-equivalent) and in the rain. First impressions were excellent; quick, responsive, and a relaxed ride when I needed it. It's really quiet, too, so a bell is essential. 

### Settling in
After 500 km I took it back to my LBS for a first service. By this point the gear cables had stretched out a bit and the changing was a bit poor. I'd adjusted it a bit but there's a limit to what one can do at home. It came back running like a sewing machine, and I've not touched it since (other than to wash it and oil it). There's so much to be said for working through a local store, and avoiding the big box sheds.

After the service I swapped out the stock saddle for a Brooks Cambium, which is their all-weather saddle. This makes so much difference it's amazing. Obviously you'll need to get a saddle that meets your needs and fits your butt, not mine.

### Touring

At some point in mid July I decided it would be a good idea to do an overnight ride. I decided against panniers / a rack and bags because of the foot/heel clearance and weight, and went down the bike packing route. 

I ended up using an Ortlieb saddle pack (4 litres – the larger version doesn't fit on the saddle post), which I partly filled with tools, a change of clothes, wash stuff, sun cream, fleece pullover and rain jacket. That comes in near 2 kilograms. The recommended limit for one of these is about 3 kg.

The Ortlieb sausage-shaped framepack doesn't fit in my frame (size medium) so I also took a lightweight running pack from Decathlon for snacks, wallet, and spare water. Two bottle cages, bottles, and a small pump from lezyne completed the picture.

The first day was fine – 60 km in the sun and no great climbs. Something like 600 m in total. The bike was very comfortable and didn't wobble with the rooster tail pack, which I was afraid might happen. Day two was 120 km and 1500m vertical because of a slight map reading error. Despite very tired legs, I have to say that the bike was excellent. Comfortable at 65 km/hr on a downhill stretch on a pass, happy grinding up gravel tracks in the woods, and nimble in city traffic.

### 3 months in: a very capable all-rounder 

I now ride three to four times a week. One of those will be a bigger ride, with up to 6 hours in the saddle. The fun thing with this bike it's about right for everything I might meet, in that it's always good enough but never too focused on being the perfect bike for those conditions.

Confused? Let me explain.

When I'm climbing up a gravel track somewhere I sometimes wish I was on a mountain bike, but then when – 10 minutes later – I'm on the road again I wish I was on a super light weight road machine. But that light road bike would have died on the gravel, and the mountain bike would be awful on the road. And both the gravel bike and road bike would be horrid in the city, where you want something more upright and nimble. The Alpenchallenge AC01-three is none of these things; it can do all of it, but without being so road, city, or gravel-oriented that it can't do the other.

## 3,000 km done
It's New Year 2021 and I've now done around 3,000 km on the bike. After the 500 km service maintenance has been very easy; I've washed it every couple of weeks, and went through a set of tires on the back, and brake pads front and back. Other than that I've not touched it. 

As hoped, it's proven to be a very versatile bike and has handled everything I've thrown at it. The last couple of weeks its had regular snow and mud rides. Sometimes the shifting has been a bit grumpy, but give it a few km and the chain, chainset, and cassette have cleared themselves pretty well and it's gone back to normal. It's been great for quick, 2-3 hour, very mixed rides in the shorter winter days here.

The only (minor) problem I've had is the lack of clearance for a mudguard. BMC will sell you something expensive or I could fit something like an [Ass Saver](https://ass-savers.com/), but I've just not got round to it. So it's my own fault!

Inevitably, though, my thoughts are turning to _n+1_ and now I know the area much better I am considering a gravel bike that I can also use as a summer tourer. Shame the delivery times are June / July 2021! I'll just have to keep riding :)

## The verdict: an excellent bike when you don't know what to expect
My bike rides have a nasty habit of starting out as a ride along the river and then turning a bit crazy. I also can't resist an interesting looking track in the woods, and love single track. Fortunately the Alpenchallenge has dealt admirably with all of those, and been a safe and reliable steed through 2020!

Check out the Alpenchallenge range at [www.bmc-switzerland.com](https://www.bmc-switzerland.com/models/city-active/alpenchallenge.html). Please note the updated models for 2021; the nearest equivalent to my bike is now the [Alpenchallenge 01 TWO](https://www.bmc-switzerland.com/alpenchallenge-01-two.html).

[^rating]: [According to BMC](https://www.bmc-switzerland.com/alpenchallenge-01-two.html), the Alpenchallenge is rated to ASTM Class "Level 2" which means "...Meant for rides on paved ways like: tarmac roads and bicycle routes, ways paved by gravel, sand or similar materials (e.g.  re road, dirt road), paved hiking trails with only few roots, thresholds, rocks and drops".
