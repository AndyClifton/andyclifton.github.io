I've been working on a new business idea together with colleagues from the Chair of Wind Energy at the University of Stuttgart.

We've set up a consultancy called enviConnect, where our goal is to deliver simple solutions to complex problems where people, energy, and the environment meet. 

We're concentrating on helping our customers benefit from the results of cutting-edge research and development, especially around the use of drones and lidar for wind monitoring.
